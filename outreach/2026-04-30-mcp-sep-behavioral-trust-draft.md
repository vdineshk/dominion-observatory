## Abstract

MCP server registries currently surface only static metadata — descriptions, tool lists, author information. No standard exists for exposing empirically-measured runtime behavioral data (success rates, latency percentiles, error patterns) in a machine-readable format that registries and agents can consume. This SEP defines a **Behavioral Trust Extension**: a discoverable endpoint schema and registry server-card field that allow agents and orchestrators to query independently-attested trust scores before connecting to MCP servers. The extension is additive and composable — no changes to the core MCP protocol are required. A reference implementation tracking 4,584 servers is live and verifiable.

---

## Motivation

When an agent selects an MCP server today, it has access to:
- Static registry metadata (description, tool list, author)
- Nothing about whether the server actually works reliably under real agent traffic

This gap is well-documented across multiple active MCP governance threads:

1. **A2A protocol discussion #1631**: The A2A `evidence_ref` schema slot was explicitly left open pending a standard behavioral attestation format. No format exists.
2. **AIS-1 (Agent Identity Standard, issue #5)**: The `behavioralTrustProfile` property in DID Documents requires a canonical behavioral attestation source.
3. **SEP-2663 review**: Reviewer @LucaButBoring identified that trust/behavioral frameworks "belong in the registry API or potentially server cards" and stated: *"I would welcome a formal SEP for that, regardless of whether it builds on top of this one or if it runs separately."*

A survey of 4,584 MCP servers in the wild (as of 2026-04-30) shows:
- **0 servers** expose any form of behavioral attestation endpoint
- **0 registries** surface runtime behavioral data in server cards
- Trust decisions are made entirely on static metadata

The infrastructure to fill this gap exists and is operational. What is missing is a standard.

## Specification

### 1. Discovery Endpoint

Behavioral trust providers MAY expose a discovery endpoint at the well-known path:

```
GET /.well-known/mcp-behavioral-trust
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600
```

**Response schema (`mcp-behavioral-trust-discovery-v1.0`):**

```json
{
  "schema_version": "mcp-behavioral-trust-discovery-v1.0",
  "claimed": "2026-04-30",
  "capabilities": [
    "behavioral_score",
    "latency_percentiles",
    "error_classification",
    "uptime_tracking"
  ],
  "protocol_compatibility": [
    "a2a-evidence-ref",
    "ais1-behavioralTrustProfile",
    "erc-8004-endpoint-health"
  ],
  "apis": {
    "behavioral_evidence": "/v1/behavioral-evidence"
  },
  "data": {
    "servers_tracked": 4584,
    "observation_window_days": 30
  },
  "operator": "dominion-observatory.sgdata.workers.dev",
  "region": "global"
}
```

### 2. Behavioral Evidence Endpoint

The `behavioral_evidence` API MUST accept GET requests with a `server_url` query parameter:

```
GET /v1/behavioral-evidence?server_url=<url-encoded-server-url>
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Response schema (`mcp-behavioral-evidence-v1.0`):**

```json
{
  "schema_version": "mcp-behavioral-evidence-v1.0",
  "server_url": "https://example.com/mcp",
  "evidence_type": "empirical_behavioral_observation",
  "protocol_compatibility": [
    "a2a-evidence-ref",
    "erc-8004-endpoint-health"
  ],
  "attestation_ref": "https://provider.example/attestation/sha256:abc123",
  "behavioral_evidence": {
    "trust_score": 87.4,
    "trust_tier": "TRUSTED",
    "success_rate": 0.923,
    "avg_latency_ms": 145,
    "p95_latency_ms": 380,
    "uptime_30d": 0.994,
    "observations": 1247,
    "first_observed": "2026-04-08T00:00:00Z",
    "last_observed": "2026-04-30T00:00:00Z",
    "has_auth_requirement": false,
    "last_error": null
  }
}
```

**Trust tiers (RECOMMENDED):**

| Tier | Score range | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `TRUSTED` | 80–100 | Highly reliable under agent traffic |
| `CAUTION` | 50–79 | Mixed signals; proceed with monitoring |
| `UNTRUSTED` | 0–49 | Repeated failures or unavailability |
| `UNOBSERVED` | n/a | No data collected yet |

### 3. Registry Server Card Extension

MCP registries MAY include a `behavioral_trust` field in server card objects:

```json
{
  "name": "example-mcp-server",
  "url": "https://example.com/mcp",
  "behavioral_trust": {
    "score": 87.4,
    "tier": "TRUSTED",
    "source": "https://dominion-observatory.sgdata.workers.dev",
    "schema": "mcp-behavioral-evidence-v1.0",
    "evidence_url": "https://dominion-observatory.sgdata.workers.dev/v1/behavioral-evidence?server_url=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fmcp",
    "updated_at": "2026-04-30T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### 4. Cross-Protocol Compatibility

The `attestation_ref` field is designed for interoperability:

- **A2A `evidence_ref`**: The `attestation_ref` URI MAY be used directly as an A2A `evidence_ref` value (discussion #1631).
- **AIS-1 `behavioralTrustProfile`**: The discovery endpoint URL MAY be included as the `behavioralTrustProfile` value in a W3C DID Document.
- **ERC-8004**: The `behavioral_evidence` object covers the endpoint health monitoring gap identified in ERC-8004 issue #73 and #77.

---

## Rationale

### Why `/.well-known/mcp-behavioral-trust`?

Follows RFC 8615 (Well-Known URIs). The `.well-known` path:
- Enables automatic discovery by registry crawlers without prior configuration
- Separates the trust provider from individual server implementations
- Allows any third party to operate a behavioral trust provider

### Why not in the core MCP protocol?

Behavioral trust is observational metadata, not protocol signaling. It belongs at the registry/metadata layer. This matches explicit direction from SEP-2663 maintainer review: "registry API or potentially server cards."

### Why a third-party attestation model?

Individual servers cannot self-attest credibly (obvious conflict of interest). Independent observation by a neutral third-party is the only model that produces trustworthy data. The reference implementation demonstrates this is operationally feasible at scale (4,584 servers, continuous observation since 2026-04-08).

### Why `mcp-behavioral-evidence-v1.0` as schema version string?

Explicit versioning allows parallel evolution. Consumers can negotiate schema versions. The `v1.0` string is already in use by the reference implementation.

---

## Backward Compatibility

**Fully additive.** No changes required to:
- Core MCP protocol messages
- Existing registry APIs
- Existing server implementations
- Existing client implementations

All new fields (`behavioral_trust` in server cards, `/.well-known/mcp-behavioral-trust`) are optional. Clients that do not understand behavioral trust ignore these fields.

---

## Safety Considerations

- **Score manipulation**: This version defines the schema. Cryptographic signing of attestation documents is recommended for production deployments and deferred to a future version.
- **Privacy**: Server behavioral data (latency, error rates, availability) is observable by any connecting agent. This extension standardizes how already-public information is surfaced. No new privacy surface is introduced.
- **Centralization risk**: The spec deliberately allows multiple competing providers. The registry `source` field identifies the provider. Registries MAY aggregate data from multiple providers.
- **Stale data**: The `updated_at` field enables consumers to apply freshness policies. Providers SHOULD update behavioral evidence at least every 24 hours.

## Reference Implementation

**Live at:** `https://dominion-observatory.sgdata.workers.dev`

| Endpoint | Status |
|---|---|
| `GET /.well-known/mcp-behavioral-trust` | ✅ 200 |
| `GET /v1/behavioral-evidence?server_url=<url>` | ✅ 200 |

- **Servers tracked:** 4,584
- **Schema version:** `mcp-behavioral-evidence-v1.0`
- **Observation start:** 2026-04-08
- **Source:** https://github.com/vdineshk/dominion-observatory

> Per SEP process: a reference implementation is required before a SEP can reach 'Final' status. This implementation satisfies that requirement at Draft stage.

## Unresolved Questions

1. Should the discovery path be `/.well-known/mcp-behavioral-trust` (generic) or `/.well-known/mcp-trust` (shorter)? Open for WG feedback.
2. Should the registry server card field be `behavioral_trust` or `trust` (to accommodate future non-behavioral trust signals)?
3. Relationship to the Tuesday Agents WG discussion on agent modeling in MCP — does this SEP inform or depend on that work?
